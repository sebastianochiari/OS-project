# CUSTOM SHELL project
## Operative Systems (UNITN)

Teacher: **Bruno Crispo**

Teacher assistant: **Eugenio Naimoli**

The goal of this project was to implement an interactive shell with the following characteristics:
* must accept at least two arguments to define the log files' names. Output and error streams must be reported into the log files.
* must execute basic bash commands, as `ls`, `wc` and `date`.
* must accept the pipe (`|`) character.
* must show a custom prompt that accepts the given commands

You can find all the specifications in the *project-specifications.pdf* file above (italian only).

The entire process is described into the *project-documentation.pdf* file above (italian only).
